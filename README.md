## Usage
 - To get started with offline calculator, open the executable file
 - On the top right of the screen you can see the menu on the calculator, all the other space is a canvas for the functions to be drawn on.
 - Top 2 rows of the calculator menu are responsible for the global zoom
 - On the third row user can set the dot at cursor parameter
 - Pressing the 4th row buttons user can add or remove functions from canvas
 - Button **-** on the left of the function removes the chosen function
 - Button hide/show hides or show the function
 - Button **Variables** allows user to change values of custom variables in function, for example in funciton *x\*a* user can change *a* value
 - The next button is color picker for the given function
 - Blue field is a place to input your function 

## Roadmap
The goal of the offline graphical calculator is to provide a lightweight, portative user-friendly way of analysing funktions 

Planned:
- [x] Improve interface
- [x] Add more functions
- [ ] Fix interface problems on windows resize
- [ ] Add possibility of Non-function graphs
